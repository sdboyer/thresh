// references-resolve: Go reaches into CUE by literal paths (cue.Str, cue.Def,
// cue.Hid). Fire when a reference no longer resolves in the CUE — the scoped
// replacement for file-level co-change. Evaluated whenever either side changed,
// against the CURRENT content of all files on both sides (a CUE rename breaks
// references in Go files this changeset never touched). Fires on wrongness.
//
// Precision: a reference is reported only if it is newly broken — it resolved at
// base, or it sits on a line this changeset added. Pre-existing unresolved
// references are not this change's doing.
